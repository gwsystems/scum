# sparcfire - Solar Powered Automatic Recycling Container For Independent Research Endeavors
Sparcfire is a smart 2-in-1 recycling and trash bin that automatically sorts recyclables from
trash. This system provides a embedded application for [sunneed](https://github.com/gwsystems/sunneed) for testing multitenancy in a power constrained system.
Sparcfire uses a raspberry pi with a camera and servos to sort recyclables from trash. Sparcfire could benefit urban areas by reducing recycling contamination and providing a city scale sensing platform.

## The System
Sparcfire uses a modified swing-lid style trash can with a recycling and trash compartment. A passerby places an item on the lid, where an overhead camera identifies the object. Sparcfire categorizes the item as recyclable or trash and unlocks the appropriote side of the swing-lid to allow the object to fall into its corresponding bin.

### Capabilites
